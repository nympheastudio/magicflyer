Apply a specific default price formula for FBA products.
This formula could be a price a value or math (multiply, divide, addition, subtraction, percentages)
Use the @ symbol as price reference (eg: @ + 10 % mean you'll add 10 % to the initial price)
If you specify nothing, the main setting will be applied.
